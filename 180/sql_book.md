<h1>SQL Book Notes</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><b>Relational Database</b> is a database organized according to the relational model of data.</p>
<p><b>Relational Model</b> defines the set of relations(which we can think of as analogous to tables) and describes the relationships, or connections between them in order to determine how the data stored in them can interact.</p>
<p>Using a relational database helps us cut down on duplicated data and provides a much more useful data structure.</p>
<p><b>Relational database management system (RDBMS)</b> is essentially a software application, or system, for managing relational databases.</p>
<p>A RDBMS allows a user, or another application, to interact with a database by issuing commands using sytax that conforms to a certain set of conventions or standards</p>
<p><b>SQL</b><em> - Structured Query Language</em> is the programming Language used to communicate with a relational database.</p>
<p>SQL uses simple English sentences</p>
<p>SQL is a declarative langauge; you describe <em>what</em> needs to be done, but not exactly <em>how</em> to do it.</p>
